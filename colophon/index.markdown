## Colophon

This site is generated using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I adapted
my current theme from [Wally Jones'](http://imwally.github.com/) theme.
I use a [mkfile](http://swtch.com/plan9port/man/man1/mk.html) and
[srvwd](http://tyrfingr.is/projects/srvwd/) to build and test the site.
The site itself is hosted on a [prgmr](http://prgmr.com) VPS.

The site's source is on [Github](https://github.com/kisom/kyleisom.net).
