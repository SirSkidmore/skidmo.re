Hello, and welcome to my small personal website.

I am an 18-year-old college freshman currently attending IU and majoring in
Computer Science. I would like to eventually focus on Natural Language
Processing and computational linguistics.

#### A Comment on Comments
This site, if and when I occasionally update it, will not feature comments.
I have a variety of personal reasons for doing so, but if you feel the need
to respond to any of the writings, feel free to send me an email or mention me
on either ADN or Twitter.

<h4>The technical...</h4>
I have an absolute love for the Ruby programming language, but I am extending
my views by taking a functional approach to programming through the Clojure
programming language. I'm currently working on a collaborative-translation site
for Guarani and Spanish. It can be found 
[here](https://github.com/hltdi/guampa).

<h4>The miscellaneous...</h4>
I have an absurd love for all office supplies, and have a vast collection of
pens, inks, and papers. I play a variety of games, both the board and video
varieties. I enjoy reading a variety of works, including anything from essays
to novels to non-fictional pieces.
