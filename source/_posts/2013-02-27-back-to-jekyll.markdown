After a long while using [octopress](octopress), I decided to switch
back to [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I found a theme I liked (from
[Wally](http://imwally.github.com), and tweaked it to fit my tastes.
Octopress is very useful, but it is a very heavyweight solution,
and I wanted something less cluttered and minimal. I'm pretty happy
with the current set up, once I made my way through the markdown
issues I started with.  I eventually settled on redcarpet2 and
[redcarpet2_markdown](https://github.com/nono/Jekyll-plugins).
