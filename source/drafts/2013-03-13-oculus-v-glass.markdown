I've been recently struck by the difference between two projects lately, 
the [Oculus Rift](http://www.oculusvr.com/) and the [Google Glass](http://www.google.com/glass/start/).
They represent the state of the art in two fundamentally different
approaches to the way we will interact in the future. Oculus represents
a **virtual reality**, while Glass represents **augmented reality**.
In virtual reality, participants interact in an entirely different world,
virtually constructed and existing only in data centers (with local
caches perhaps existing on the participants' machines). Augmented reality
overlays an information layer on top of the real world. What's interesting
to me is the different approaches participants take: in virtual reality,
participants are separated from the real world, while augmented reality
causes its participants to interact with the real world in new ways. It's
the difference between Second Life and Ingress. Virtual reality affords
participants the ability to construct physically impossible worlds and
to alter the dynamics of those worlds, while augment reality necessarily
is constrained to our world. As an avid reader of cyberpunk, I can't
help but compare the approaches to some of the novels
I've read in the past: virtual reality as exemplified in
[Snow Crash](http://www.nealstephenson.com/snowcrash/) and the
envisionment of cyberspace in many of William Gibson's novels, such as
[Neuromancer](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/books/neuromancer.asp);
and augmented reality as seen in Charlie Stross'
[Accelerando](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html)
and Vernor Vinge's [Rainbow's End](http://us.macmillan.com/rainbowsend/VernorVinge). The
Oculus team has mentioned Ernest Cline's [Ready Player One](http://www.readyplayerone.com/)
as a major influence and inspiration, as well (and on that recommendation, I recently read
the book).

While I haven't tried either Glass or the Rift
(although I am a backer of the Rift's [Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game)
and eagerly anticipating my headset), I'd still like to try to imagine
their impact on the world. I'm looking at these two projects in particular
as they appear to me to be the leaders in their field, and they are both
commercially backed projects. While they are building on numerous Maker projects,
this is the point where we see these beginning to enter the commercial space.
There are a few projects previously that have been commercial attempts to
enter the market (such as the offerings by [Vuzix](http://www.vuzix.com/)
but so far these have failed to gain mass-market traction.

What are the implications of commercially successfuly VR and AR?

### VIRTUAL REALITY

The attraction to virtual reality is the ability to construct and
manipulate a reality that is not tied to the physical properties
of our world; this has traditionally been tied to the world of video
games. Second Life was (is) a notable exception, in that it is less of a
game and more of an actual world, with its own economy and subcultures
with less gamification. In Ready Player One, the OASIS exists as a
sort of combination of World of Warcraft and Second Life: players can
participate in virtual school, watch movies, and still participate in
quests and games. Much of the world uses OASIS to escape a collapsing
human society and extreme poverty.

However, the technology presently remains expensive (although notably
less expensive than Glass): the developer kit is, as of the time of
writing this, available for preorder for 300 USD. Within a few years,
I foresee the price coming down into a much more affordable range. As the
product is still in its infancy, it is marketed towards hardcore gamers,
and the focus now is on immersive gaming. In the not-so-distant future,
there are a couple of areas where this could expand into:

0. Multimedia: truly immersive cinematic experiences, or the ability to
listen to an album as if in a concert hall or auditorium;

0. Telecommuting / conferencing: Second Life has seen some of this,
where geographically-separated people can virtually get together to hold
a meeting. With improvements in graphics processing, realistic avatars
representing the participants would be likely; however, the headset
alone doesn't provide for features like rendering facial expressions.

0. Desktop environments: we are beginning to see some movement in
the realm of Minority Report-eqsue user interfaces. Combine something
like a micro-kinect (suitable for clipping onto a laptop, at least for
early models), and you could have an immersive desktop. This opens some
interesting possibilities for interface options.

This biggest social implication of VR is that it removes the participant
from the world.

### AUGMENTED REALITY

Augmented reality presents a 'hidden world' overlaid on the real world;
hidden in the sense that two observers, one participating in the augmented
reality and one not, will see two different things.
