title: Moving Back to Jekyll
categories: [jekyll, wordpress]

A few months ago, I posted about my move to the WordPress system, away from Jekyll. After two months of really enjoying using WordPress, I really began to hit a lot of limitations, so I started investigating a move back to Jekyll. I originally had intended on simply porting my "svbtle" theme, but later found [@Kyleisom's](http://alpha.app.net/kyleisom) really cool Jekyll site.

Over the course of two nights, I have completely moved away from WordPress, and back on Jekyll. I have a few more small changes I'd like to make to the Jekyll theme (like add Disqus comments), but overall, I'm really happy with how it looks.

If you have any suggestions for the site, feel free to let me know!

P.S. My homepage looks much less impressive now that all my posts are simply listed instead of showing a preview, I'll probably need to post more in the next few weeks.
