<p>I happened upon the <a href="http://lispinsummerprojects.org/" title="LISP">Lisp In Summer Projects</a> competition the other day via Hacker News. I've ventured into the lands of Lisp before, but I've never truly stopped to enjoy the language before now. Since the competition begins on June 21, and I've never actually used the language, I've begun to dig further into the depths of Clojure. I'll be publishing a few different posts about my experiences, joys, and difficulties in learning the language and building a tangible, real-world project.</p>

<h2>(([])(()))#{()}()()()()(())</h2>

<p>So yeah, there's parentheses, and lots of them. At first, I found the syntax foreign and a little off-putting, but the more I began to use the language, the more I began to appreciate its unique looks. When I began programming with Clojure, I used Vim with the amazing <a href="https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim" title="kien/rainbow_parentheses">Rainbow Parentheses</a> plugin that made it easier to see "balanced" sets of parentheses. Really neat-looking stuff, and now it's pretty easy to see the balanced parentheses without plugins and such.</p>

<h2>Lisp In Summer Projects</h2>

<p>I'm not completely sure where I want to start with this (as is the problem with many of my projects), but I'm relatively sure I'll be building an ADN client with node-webkit and ClojureScript that runs well on Linux platforms. Since I want to work with the ADN API, I'll need to upgrade to a "development" account sometime between now and June 21st. I'll get around to it eventually I think.</p>

<h2>Continuing</h2>

<p>I'm not sure what I'll do Clojure-wise between now and the beginning of LISP, but I'll (hopefully) be posting updates as my Clojure experiments move forward.</p>
