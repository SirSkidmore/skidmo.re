Hello, and welcome to my wonderfully mediocre site!

I am Taylor Skidmore, an aspiring 17-year-old programmer, and a not-so-aspiring Horn in F player. That's pretty much it. I won't promise this blog will be terribly exciting, but it may eventually contain some interesting ideas and thoughts (hopefully).

<h4>The technical...</h4>
I am relatively acclimated with the Ruby programming language, but have a general idea about several more languages, including JavaScript, Clojure, and Haskell. I am looking to contribute to open source projects, and hopefully begin several projects rooted in my local community.

<h4>The miscellaneous...</h4>
I absolutely love music, play the Horn in F, and listen to just about every genre available to my ears. I have an absurd love for all office supplies, and have a vast collection of pens, inks, and papers.

<h5>Colophon...</h5>
