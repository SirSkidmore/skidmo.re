<h2>What I Hate About Education</h2>

Disclaimer: I love to learn, read and write. This is a rant I've been harboring for a long time.


For as long as I can remember, school has not helped me reach my primary goal: learning. I don't remember the last time I actually took a class in order to learn (with one minor exception, discussed later); I have only ever taken classes for a series of numbers on a piece of paper that gets sent to businesses my teachers like to call "colleges." If that number is above a “90,” I may be congratulated with the possibility of a $100 scholarship, which might have the potential to buy a whole textbook! 


On the other hand, if I score below a “90,”  — the dreaded 'B' range — I will be congratulated with a brick wall when I go to fill out dozens of scholarship forms and college admission applications. School, after all, in no way prepares us for the "real world" or even "learning." Instead, it has conditioned youth to hunt for the best grades and memorization, not the best understanding or skill-set.


At the end of my freshman year, when schedules became available, our "guidance" counselors spoke to us about the upper echelons of primary education: Advanced Placement (AP) classes. 


"It could save you hundreds of dollars," I was told, "taking a $95 test could possibly save you several hundred dollars come freshman year of college." Not once did he say, "most of you will have to work really hard" or "you'll have a much deeper understanding of important events in world history." I signed up for the class anyway.


Come sophomore year, I sat contemplating in my "advanced placement" world history class. I thought, "this is much harder than 'regular' (colloquially: 'dumb-kid classes' in my circle of peers) classes." Then, it hit me. I struggled more in that AP class not because I had to learn or understand more, rather, I had to memorize more. I didn't have to know what the real motive behind the Opium War was, I just needed to know it involved England and China and took place around 1840 during the Qing Dynasty. There was no discussion. There was no understanding. Just memorization from large PowerPoint presentations and endless sheets of vocabulary words.


Enter junior year. No matter how I rotated my schedule, "advanced" English simply would not fit, so: "dumb-kid" English it was. First day of class, and the teacher showed us the "Black Knight" scene from <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail. </em>When the video concluded, the teacher asked (bear with me here, it gets worse) to write as many verbs from the video as we could remember. I was one of five, maybe six, students (in a class of nearly thirty) who could do it. 


Later in the year, the teacher had to ask me to <em>leave</em> the class because the other students were intimated by my ability to identify sentence structures with such ease already. At the time, we had just gotten a worksheet about prepositions and simple sentences; it looked striking similar to the same one I completed in the seventh grade. What was happening? Why were my classmates so stunningly behind the kids in "smarter" classes? I thought about it as I stared at my blank worksheet in the media center and remained puzzled for the remainder of the period.


Days later, working silently (back in class), I finally understood why I felt so far ahead; why my "honors" peers were so ahead: we were taught to understand, not memorize, but not because we had taken an "honors" class, but because the teacher actually taught! We weren't handed dates to memorize, or a list of prepositions or conjunctions, rather, we actually <em>learned</em> how to understand sentence structure. My freshman "honors" English teacher taught us, instead of reading from a PowerPoint or handing out menial worksheets. I still rarely learned in my other advanced classes, but I could at least understand the material on a deeper level by reading the abundance of class materials online.


Enter: the Grade Hunters. Several of the "smarter" kids in my class began to drop honors and advanced classes, soaring to the top of the class ranks. Why? Because the only difference between advanced classes and normal classes were the levels of memorization needed. As more people began earn higher grades because they only needed to know what a verb was instead of a compound sentence, their GPAs improved, and their chances for scholarships sky-rocketed. Our guidance counselors, however, assured the advanced classes that colleges weighed more on class difficulty than class grade. It didn't matter though, no matter which way you cut it, mostly “A”s with a few “B”s sprinkled on top trumped the opposite any day. I was being screwed out of a considerable chunk of cash because I was promised I could save a bit of change. Doesn't seem terribly fair.


My school tried to compensate for grade hunters by offering a GPA weight for advanced classes: “B”s would weigh as “A-”s, “A-”s as “B+”s, so on and so forth. But colleges accepted only “unweighted” GPAs. See the issue? Yeah. Problem: I can't afford college. Solution: None.


A user on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5289661">HN</a> describes it perfectly:

<blockquote>America has a problem where if students were taught about proper financial management and making proper financial decisions the college system would fall apart, because students are expected to commit to huge debts that are often very questionable decisions.</blockquote>


Quite frankly, I don't know what the hell I'm doing, or where I'm going. Schools keep telling me to spend a small fortune to attend their programs and "be a [insert mascot here]." I don't want to be an "anything." I want to be able to afford to learn about the career I choose to study. Rather, colleges want me to spend money that I don't actually have so they can build bigger stadiums, or whatever.


This isn't how college, or high school, should be. I should be in school to learn about the world around (and ahead of) me. Instead, I've only learned that the only thing that apparently matters is how well I score on a single test, or how well I can memorize some dates or formulas, or how much I hate the bureaucracy of education.
