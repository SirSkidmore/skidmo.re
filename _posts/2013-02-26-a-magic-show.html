<p>For as long as I can remember, magic shows have always blown my mind. The art of manipulation and illusions blended what was real and what wasn't, and I only wanted to live in that small blended reality. For several years, I was absolutely obsessed with magic: card tricks, saw-the-pretty-lady-in-half tricks, and any other illusion you can imagine; I wanted to be a magician.</p>

<p>Time moved on, and so did I. I changed my mind hundreds more times before I finally decided what I thought I really wanted to do (Computer Sciences), but the magic of magic rarely left my mind for more than a few days.</p>

<p>This past Sunday, I attended a friend's "surprise" birthday party at a local coffee shop; there was plenty of food, laughs, music, and (most importantly) coffee. After about an hour or so, I was reminded that this particular friend's dad was an accountant by day, but a relatively popular professional magician by night. Memories of staring wide-eyed a magic shows flashed in my head, and I childishly whispered to the birthday boy, "Would your dad maybe show us a few magic tricks?" A few minutes later, when I saw the large wooden case being carried into the door I felt like a kid again; a kid who just loved magic.</p>

<p>For about an hour I sat in the front seat, watching a man I had only fleetingly met a few times perform amazing sleight of hands, producing cards and coins out of thin air, only to make them disappear with another snap of his fingers. I obviously knew all of the tricks could be explained with tangible science -that the tricks were simply illusions- but I remained completely captivated. The magician asked for a volunteer, my hand shot up, he asked for a five dollar bill, I handed him a twenty. Before my very eyes, he turned my twenty dollar bill into a one. I knew it wasn't in any way my twenty dollar bill, that the bill was simply in his pocket or sleeve, but I couldn't help the stupid grin growing on my face, or my stupefied clap which echoed in the small brick shop.</p>

<p>After the show, I returned the magician's one, he handed me my twenty, and said, "I didn't think you'd be so easy to fool," which made me think. Why were the illusions so captivating and mysterious? Why did I always watch these tricks, but never make a real attempt to hone the craft? Because that would take the magic out of all of the magic, I concluded. If I knew how the tricks worked -if I even thought about how any of the tricks worked- a relatively large chunk of my childhood wold be taken away from me, and all the "magic" would be gone. And where's the fun in that?</p>
