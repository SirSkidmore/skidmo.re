If you've actually been here before, you may have noticed some slight changes. Going against the recent trends flocking towards static page generators, I have actually moved my site off of Jekyll and onto WordPress. The changes will hopefully encourage me to spend less time endlessly tweaking my site and more time publishing my thoughts.

So, cheers to breaking the trends, a mediocre website, and an uninspiring post!
