The [Chromebook Pixel](https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=chromebook_pixel_wifi)
is Google's latest entry in the Chromebook line, but represents an
unconvential take on the product line. Whereas previously there has
been a trend towards cheaper Chromebooks, culminating in the
[Acer C7 Chromebook](https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=chromebook_acer_c710),
a $199 netbook. The Pixel, however, is nearly three times the cost of the
previous most expensive model (the $450 WiFi Series 5 Chromebook, compared
to the $1,299 Wifi Chromebook Pixel). This is an interesting departure
from the goals of the previous Chromebooks, which were introduced as
"computers for everyone." (In fact, ChromeOS reminds me of the old
Microsoft adage, "computers on every desk and in every home.") However, I
have mixed feelings about the Pixel. In the interests of full disclosure, I
currently own a pair of Chromebooks, a CR48 that I picked up for 150 USD on
Ebay, and a Series 3 (ARM) Chromebook I bought locally.

The Pixel's most interesting feature is it's extremely large touch display.
Its specs square it up as a competitor to the Macbook Air and the Lenovo
x230. These specs aren't required for ChromeOS's primary goal, which is to
run everything in the cloud, so the specs are a bit unusual for the line.
